It is hard for humans to manually extract the summary of a really large documents. So in those cases we can use text summarizers . Text summarizer identifies the meaningful information in a document and summarizes it by preserving the overall meaning. This code presents a shorter version of the original text while preserving the semantics of the whole document.

Using the similarity matric the Top k dissimilar sentences are taken to form a summary of the whole text.
